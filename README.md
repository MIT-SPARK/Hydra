This repository contains code to incrementally build 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs (DSGs) in real-time and is primarily based on the paper ["Hydra: A Real-time Spatial Perception System for 3D Scene Graph Construction and Optimization"](http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss18/p050.pdf). If you find this code relevant for your work, please consider citing this paper. A bibtex entry is provided below:

### General Requirements

Hydra has been tested on the following systems:

- Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Melodic
- Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic (*recommended*)

You can follow the instructions [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) to install ROS if you haven't already.

Then, make sure you have some general requirements:

For melodic:
```
sudo apt install python-rosdep python-catkin-tools python3-vcstool
```

For noetic:
```
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-catkin-tools python3-vcstool
```

Finally, if you haven't set up rosdep yet:
```
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

### Building Hydra

To get started:

```
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws
catkin init
catkin config -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGTSAM_TANGENT_PREINTEGRATION=OFF \
              -DGTSAM_BUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE=OFF -DOPENGV_BUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE=OFF
catkin config --blacklist hdf5_map_io mesh_msgs_hdf5 label_manager mesh_tools \
                          rviz_map_plugin minkindr_python

cd src
git clone git@github.com:MIT-SPARK/Hydra.git hydra
vcs import . < hydra/install/hydra.rosinstall

rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
sudo apt install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

cd ..
catkin build
```

:warning: Depending on the amount of RAM available on your machine and whether or not you are compiling Kimera-VIO as well, you may run out of memory when compiling with `catkin build` directly (which will result in a `GCC killed` error). If this occurs, you can either specify fewer threads for catkin via `catkin build -j NUM_THREADS` or compile certain larger packages (e.g. gtsam) directly first by building them specifically, e.g. `catkin build gtsam`.

Please help us by creating new issues when you run into problems with these instructions!

Finally, if you'd prefer to use the older `wstool` instead of `vcs`, you can do the following instead of `vcs import`:
```
wstool init
wstool merge hydra/install/hydra.rosinstall
wstool up
```

### Running Hydra (Quickstart)

The only dataset that is supported out-of-the-box is [uHumans2](http://web.mit.edu/sparklab/datasets/uHumans2/).
To test Hydra out, you can just download a single scene (the office scene without humans is recommended, and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1CA_1Awu-bewJKpDrILzWok_H_6cOkGDb).
Make sure to decompress the rosbag (`rosbag decompress path/to/bagfile`) before running!

:warning: Also make sure to source the workspace before starting (typically `source path/to/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash`, though if you use zsh you should use the correct setup file for that).

To start Hydra:
```
roslaunch hydra_dsg_builder uhumans2_incremental_dsg.launch start_visualizer:=true
```

Then, start the rosbag in a separate terminal:
```
rosbag play path/to/rosbag --clock
```

### Using Kimera-VIO

:warning: Hydra relies on unreleased changes to Kimera-VIO to handle visual loop-closures and receive the robot pose graph. The current public version of Kimera-VIO that Hydra points to will not generate loop closures or pose graph information for Hydra, but has been tested against the `uHumans2_office_s1_00h.bag.bag.bag.bag`.

You can configure your workspace to also include Kimera-VIO by:
```
roscd && cd ../src
vcs import . < hydra/install/vio_public_overlay.rosinstall

catkin build
```

To run Hydra using Kimera:

```
roslaunch kimera_vio_ros kimera_vio_ros kimera_vio_ros_uhumans2.launch

# in separate terminal
roslaunch hydra_dsg_builder uhumans2_incremental_dsg.launch \
     start_visualizer:=true \
     use_gt_frame:=false
```

To achieve the best results with Kimera-VIO, you should run the rosbag for about half a second, pause to wait for the LCD vocabulary to load, and then unpause the rosbag.

### Using a Semantic Segmentation Network

:warning: This package is not public (yet)

Add `semantic_recolor` to your workspace via:

```
roscd && cd ../src
vcs import . < hydra/install/semantic_overlay.rosinstall
```

Then, follow the instructions to install cuda and other dependencies for the `semantic_recolor` package (which can be found [here](https://github.mit.edu/SPARK/semantic_recolor_nodelet#semantic-recolor-utilities)).

Finally, build your workspace:

```
catkin build
```

### Components

See the following for more information:
  - [hydra_dsg_builder](hydra_dsg_builder/README.md)
  - [hydra_topology](hydra_topology/README.md)
  - [hydra_utils](hydra_utils/README.md)

### Filing Issues

:warning: We don't support other platforms. Issues requesting support on other platforms (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04, Windows) will be summarily closed.
