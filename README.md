This repository contains code to incrementally build 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs (DSGs) in real-time and is based on the papers:
  - ["Hydra: A Real-time Spatial Perception System for 3D Scene Graph Construction and Optimization"](http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss18/p050.pdf)
  - ["Foundations of Spatial Perception for Robotics: Hierarchical Representations and Real-time Systems"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07154)

If you find this code relevant for your work, please consider citing one or both of these papers. A bibtex entry is provided below:

## News

**Update (06/26/23):** We've released initial changes from the our newest paper.
We also plan to release additional code, most notably for training the room classification networks and GNN-based descriptors as described in the above paper.
We will link to the new repository once this is done.

:warning: As part of the this release, we have moved ROS related code to a new repository located [here](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra-ROS). This code (and our installation process) still do rely on the ROS ecosystem.

## Installation and Running

### General Requirements

Hydra has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic

:warning: Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Melodic are no longer actively tested

You can follow the instructions [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) to install ROS if you haven't already.
Then, make sure you have some general requirements:
```
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-catkin-tools python3-vcstool
```

Finally, if you haven't set up rosdep yet:
```
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

### Filing Issues

:warning: We don't support other platforms. Issues requesting support on other platforms (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04, Windows) will be summarily closed.

Depending on the nature of the issue, it may be helpful to browse [this](doc/debugging.md) page about debugging Hydra first.

### Building Hydra

To get started:

```
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws
catkin init
catkin config -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGTSAM_TANGENT_PREINTEGRATION=OFF \
              -DGTSAM_BUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE=OFF
catkin config --skiplist hdf5_map_io mesh_msgs_hdf5 label_manager mesh_tools \
                         rviz_map_plugin minkindr_python

cd src
git clone git@github.com:MIT-SPARK/Hydra.git hydra
vcs import . < hydra/install/hydra.rosinstall

rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
sudo apt install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

cd ..
catkin build
```

:warning: Depending on the amount of RAM available on your machine and whether or not you are compiling Kimera-VIO as well, you may run out of memory when compiling with `catkin build` directly (which will result in a `GCC killed` error). If this occurs, you can either specify fewer threads for catkin via `catkin build -j NUM_THREADS` or compile certain larger packages (e.g. gtsam) directly first by building them specifically, e.g. `catkin build gtsam`.

:warning: In the `vcs import` step, GitHub may block too many concurrent requests. If you receive `kex_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer` errors, try running `vcs import . < hydra/install/hydra.rosinstall --workers 1`.

Please help us by creating new issues when you run into problems with these instructions!

### Quickstart

To test Hydra out, you can just download a single scene (the office scene without humans is recommended, and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1CA_1Awu-bewJKpDrILzWok_H_6cOkGDb).
Make sure to decompress the rosbag (`rosbag decompress path/to/bagfile`) before running!

:warning: Also make sure to source the workspace before starting (typically `source path/to/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash`, though if you use zsh you should use the correct setup file for that).

To start Hydra:
```
roslaunch hydra_ros uhumans2.launch
```

Then, start the rosbag in a separate terminal:
```
rosbag play path/to/rosbag --clock
```

### Running Hydra

See [here](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra-ROS/blob/main/doc/quickstart.md) for detailed instructions discussing how to run Hydra using ROS.
These also detail how to use Hydra with [Kimera-VIO](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-VIO.git), including how to build Kimera-VIO alongside Hydra.

### Using a Semantic Segmentation Network

:warning: This package is not public (yet)

Add `semantic_recolor` to your workspace via:

```
roscd && cd ../src
vcs import . < hydra/install/semantic_overlay.rosinstall
```

Then, follow the instructions to install cuda and other dependencies for the `semantic_recolor` package (which can be found [here](https://github.mit.edu/SPARK/semantic_recolor_nodelet#semantic-recolor-utilities)).

Finally, build your workspace:

```
catkin build
```

### Config Library

Hydra has a wrapper around config parsing that is documented [here](doc/config_parsing.md).
