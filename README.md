## News

**Update (01/28/25):** We've released a new version of Hydra. This involves the following changes:
  - Open-set semantic capabilities used by downstream projects (i.e., [Khronos](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Khronos) and [Clio](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Clio))
  - A clear separation between colors and semantic labels. Hydra no longer assigns colors to nodes when building a scene graph; this is done by the visualizer
  - Instructions for using a real semantic segmentation model via [semantic_inference](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/semantic_inference.git)
  - Internal refactoring and cleanup

> **Node**<br>
> We've updated our rosinstall file to point to the `main` branch of Kimera-PGMO. Please make sure you have the right branch checked out!

**Update (06/26/24):** We've released the latest version of Hydra.
This release also includes the following features:
  - Room category classification networks from our most recent paper, available [here](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra-GNN)
  - Python bindings around Hydra and our interface for running with the habitat simulator (details below)
  - Updates to Hydra to use [config_utilities](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/config_utilities)

> **Note**<br>
> We've changed (and simplified) the dependencies required to build Hydra. This includes moving towards the ROS packaged version of GTSAM, dropping Kimera-Semantics and replacing voxblox with [spatial_hash](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Spatial-Hash).
> Please make sure to double-check the rosinstall files to make sure you have all new dependencies (and feel free to remove unused old dependencies).

**Update (06/26/23):** We've released initial changes from the our newest paper.
We also plan to release additional code, most notably for training the room classification networks and GNN-based descriptors as described in the above paper.
We will link to the new repository once this is done.

> **Note**<br>
> As part of the this release, we have moved ROS related code to a new repository located [here](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra-ROS). This code (and our installation process) still do rely on the ROS ecosystem.

## Installation and Running

### General Requirements

Hydra has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic

You can follow the instructions [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) to install ROS if you haven't already.
Then, make sure you have some general requirements:
```
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-catkin-tools python3-vcstool
```

Finally, if you haven't set up rosdep yet:
```
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

### Filing Issues

> **:warning: Warning**<br>
> We don't support other platforms. Issues requesting support on other platforms (e.g., Ubuntu 18.04, Windows) will be summarily closed.

Depending on the nature of the issue, it may be helpful to browse [this](doc/debugging.md) page about debugging Hydra first.

### Building Hydra

To get started:

```
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws
catkin init
catkin config -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

cd src
git clone git@github.com:MIT-SPARK/Hydra.git hydra
vcs import . < hydra/install/hydra.rosinstall
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y

cd ..
catkin build
```

> **Note**<br>
> Depending on the amount of RAM available on your machine and whether or not you are compiling Kimera-VIO as well, you may run out of memory when compiling with `catkin build` directly (which will result in a `GCC killed` error). If this occurs, you can either specify fewer threads for catkin via `catkin build -j NUM_THREADS` or compile certain larger packages directly first by building them specifically.

> :warning: **Warning**</br>
> In the `vcs import` step, GitHub may block too many concurrent requests. If you receive `kex_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer` errors, try running `vcs import . < hydra/install/hydra.rosinstall --workers 1`.

Please help us by creating new issues when you run into problems with these instructions!

### Quickstart

To test Hydra out, you can just download a single scene (the office scene without humans is recommended, and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1CA_1Awu-bewJKpDrILzWok_H_6cOkGDb).
Make sure to decompress the rosbag (`rosbag decompress path/to/bagfile`) before running!

> **:warning: Warning**<br>
> Also make sure to source the workspace before starting.<br>
> This is typically `source path/to/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash`, though if you use zsh you should use the correct setup file for that.

To start Hydra:
```
roslaunch hydra_ros uhumans2.launch
```

Then, start the rosbag in a separate terminal:
```
rosbag play path/to/rosbag --clock
```

### Running Hydra

See [here](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra-ROS/blob/main/doc/quickstart.md) for detailed instructions discussing how to run Hydra using ROS.
These also detail how to use Hydra with [Kimera-VIO](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-VIO.git), including how to build Kimera-VIO alongside Hydra.

### Hydra Python Bindings

See [here](python/README.md) for information

### Hydra Evaluation

See [here](eval/README.md) for information

### Using a Semantic Segmentation Network

Add `semantic_inference` to your workspace via:

```
roscd && cd ../src
vcs import . < hydra/install/semantic_overlay.rosinstall
```

Then, follow the instructions to install cuda and other dependencies for the `semantic_inference` package (which can be found [here](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/semantic_inference/blob/main/docs/closed_set.md#getting-dependencies)).

Finally, build your workspace:

```
catkin build
```
